# jhonstart · CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

- Promoted from workspace subdir to standalone repository under
  `botopink/jhonstart`. Tracked from `botopink/projects` as a git submodule on
  the `feat` branch.
- `Router` and `Request` read their fields through zero-argument methods
  (`router.pathname()`, `req.params()`, `req.query()`): `get` is no longer a
  keyword, so the `get name(self: Self)` accessors did not parse. Their host
  hooks are `pub declare fn`, so both declaration files parse whole.

## 0.0.1 — v0.beta.8

- `html """…"""` DSL implemented in real `.bp` (stack-based parser, dual lowering
  via `@ExprCustom<Element>`).
- Component model: function returning `Element`, real builder chain.
- Hook family in real `.bp`: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`,
  `useReducer`.
- Server components: `*fn … -> @Future<Element>` skeleton (the `*fn`
  carrier was migrated to the `#[@future]` annotation in v0.beta.12 and
  the legacy prefix removed in v0.beta.19).
- Synchronous SSR (`renderToString`).

## 0.0.0 — v0.beta.5

- Initial spec and framework scaffold (the port).
