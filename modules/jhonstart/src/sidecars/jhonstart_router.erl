%% jhonstart — the router's host half on the BEAM (front 26).
%%
%% The erlang twin of `../router_runtime.mjs`, cell for cell, so that
%% `test/router_test.bp` is ONE set of assertions run on both rows — the only
%% statement about a port worth making.
%%
%% The store is the calling process's dictionary, which is what a server render
%% wants: a request is a process, the snapshot dies with it, and two concurrent
%% renders cannot see each other's route. Nothing here is a supervised name, an
%% ETS table or an application — a router that outlives its request is a router
%% that answers the previous reader's question.
%%
%% This module parses nothing and matches nothing. The five values arrive
%% already encoded exactly as front 23's payload carries them (`p`, `m`, `q`,
%% `r`, plus the per-layout `selected`); the matcher and the route table are
%% front 22's and are compiled once, not twice.
%%
%% The module atom may not be `router`: `shipErlSidecars` skips an atom that
%% matches a module the build emitted, and the skip is silent. `jhonstart_router`
%% is the `<lib>_<name>` shape rakun's sidecars use for the same reason.

%% An unfilled snapshot answers the empty document rather than raising: a

%% The six verbs behind one cell.
%%
%% On the server `push` and `replace` RECORD a 307 redirect on the response —
%% they do not perform one, because the response is the dispatcher's to write
%% and this module is called from inside the render. `back`, `forward`,
%% `refresh` and `prefetch` are no-ops: there is no history on the server, and
%% re-requesting a payload is the browser's move.
%%
%% Recording it in the process dictionary rather than raising is what lets
%% `push("/x")` be asserted as "does not raise, and the redirect is there" in
%% the same process that rendered.
