// jhonstart — the router's host half on the js row (front 26).
//
// The route snapshot is one of the three things that CROSSES: the server fills
// it before the render, and the client rebuilds it from front 30's payload (`globals.payload`)
// on hydration and on every client-side transition. `router.bp` reads
// it through five cells; this module is what those cells are on node and in
// the browser, and `src/sidecars/jhonstart_router.erl` is the same five on the
// BEAM over the process dictionary.
//
// It is deliberately a plain module-global store and nothing else. The five
// values arrive already encoded exactly as the payload carries them (`p`, `m`,
// `q`, `r`, plus the per-layout `selected`), so this module parses nothing,
// matches nothing and knows no route table — a second matcher is a matcher
// that disagrees with the server about precedence on the routes nobody tested.
//
// `fill` is the only writer. A client navigation calls it with the values the
// payload carried and re-renders; the server adapter calls it once per request.
// Nothing here is reactive: re-rendering is the caller's job, because the
// router is a snapshot and not a subscription.

// The navigation verbs, all six behind one cell. On the server they record a

// cell rather than six, and so that a verb nobody has wired yet is a no-op and
// not a crash.
//
// Every call is recorded first, so `lastNavigation()` answers on a node row
// that has no `history` at all — the same one-line assertion the erlang half
// answers with the redirect it recorded.
